// # Trigger Component (Dropdown, Custom Flavor) --- SLDS for React

// > See a [live example](/react/dropdown) of the Dropdown component in action

// ## API

/* @todo Add a full API description of the control here. */

// ## Dependencies

// Bring in the [shared library functions](../../lib/lib.html).
import { merge, runHelpers } from 'slds-for-js-core/lib';

// ### React
// React is an external dependency of the project.
import React from 'react';

// #### classNames
// [github.com/JedWatson/classnames](https://github.com/JedWatson/classnames)
// Fa√ßades uses `classnames`, "a simple javascript utility for conditionally
// joining classNames together." Because of the small size of the library, the
// default build includes the entire library rather than requiring it as an
// external dependency.
import classNames from 'classnames';

// [Button](../button.html)
import Button from '../button';

// ## DropdownObject
export const TriggerDefinition = {
	// ### Display Name
	displayName: 'Trigger',

	// ### Render
	render () {
		const {
			ariaExpanded,
			className,
			id,
			onKeyDown,
			onKeyPress,
			// ### Additional properties
			// We allow allowing additional cleanly with [object destructuring](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/transferring-props.html#transferring-with-...-in-jsx).
			...props
		} = this.props;

		return (
			<li className={classNames('slds-context-bar-action', 'slds-grid', className)}
				id={id}
				ariaExpanded={ariaExpanded}
				onKeyDown={onKeyDown}
				onKeyPress={onKeyPress}
				{...props}
			><a className={classNames('slds-context-bar-action__label', 'slds-context-bar-action__label--expand', 'slds-text-link--reset', 'slds-grid', 'slds-grid--vertical-align-center')} >Menu Item 1</a>
				<Button
					assistiveText="Assistive text for submenu"
					className="slds-context-bar-action__trigger"
					iconStyle="icon-bare"
					icon="utility.down"
					aria-haspopup="true"
				/>
				{this.props.menu}
			</li>
		);

};


// ## Trigger

// SLDS for React **extends objects** by merging them together, rather than
// via the prototype chain or imitation of object-oriented inheritance.
// The important thing to remember is that _some methods will be available
// to the component which are not declared in this file_.

// These are not magic methods, they're not black box methods, but you do need
// to trace the dependencies of the component to see where they are coming
// from.

let Trigger = merge(
	{},
	TriggerDefinition
);

// `Helpers` are a feature of SLDS for React that allows anyone to register code that
// can manipulate the component before it is encapsulated in a React class.
//
// This allows flexibility for adding custom behavior without modifying the
// original source, or for adding optional behavior.
//
// Nothing in the component itself should ever depend on the presence
// of helpers, as they are completely optional.
Trigger = runHelpers('react', 'Trigger', Trigger);

// Once everything has been merged together and all registered helpers have
// been run we can create the React class and export the result for
// consumption by our apps.
Trigger = React.createClass(Trigger);

export default Trigger;
