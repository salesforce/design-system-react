These three mixins hook into native React lifecycle events and expose functionality needed for a cross-framework core. For example, some places in the core or traits a `setState` method is used. In React this is built in to the framework, and the other facades simply borrow the idea for their own use. Similarly, a `setProperties` method is available but in React it is actually a `noop` because React expects a one-way data flow, while in other Frameworks it typically does something very similar to `setState`.\n\tmixins: [State, Events, genericWillMount],\n\n\t// Always use the canonical control name (set in the core) as the React display name.\n\tdisplayName: CONTROL,\n\n\tpropTypes: {\n\t\tassistiveText: React.PropTypes.string,\n\t\ticon: isIcon,\n\t\ticonPosition: React.PropTypes.oneOf(Object.keys(ButtonViewCore.iconPositions)),\n\t\ticonSize: React.PropTypes.oneOf(Object.keys(ButtonViewCore.buttonIconSizes)),\n\t\ticonStyle: React.PropTypes.oneOf(Object.keys(ButtonCore.iconButtonStyles)),\n\t\tselected: React.PropTypes.bool,\n\t\tselectable: React.PropTypes.bool,\n\t\tsize: React.PropTypes.oneOf(Object.keys(ButtonCore.sizes)),\n\t\ttext: React.PropTypes.string,\n\t\ttheme: React.PropTypes.oneOf(Object.keys(ButtonCore.themes))\n\n\t\t/* TODO: Decide if this valid.
