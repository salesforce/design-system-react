// # Assistive Technology / Keyboard Navigable Trait for Dialogs with Tabbable content

/*
 * Guidelines for Popover
 *
 * - Focus is trapped. Tabbing to an index outside of the dialog is not allowed. Popover must be closed first via ESC.
 * - There should always be a focusable element inside, to place user focus on such as a close button
 * - Must be dismissible via ESC and a close button
 * - Uses tabIndex in wrapper and has tabbable items within it despite being outside document flow.
 * - Entire popover receives focus when opened and has a aria-labelledby that points to the header id, so it will read the heading,
 * - Must return focus to trigger after closing.
 * - F6 will allow the user to keep popover open and go back to tabbing in “app-context” instead of “dialog-context.” (not implemented, yet)
