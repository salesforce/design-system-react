It typically overlays other elements in the document flow. This is achieved with elevation (`z-index`) and one of the following: relative position, absolute position, or a new top-level React render tree (portal). A boundary element is a scrolling ancestor element or the edge of the browser (window/viewport). This element typically has an overflow (overflow-y/overflow-x) style that is scroll, hidden, or auto. Inverted placement is the flipping of the overlay element from top to bottom or left to right in order stay within a boundary element.\n *\n * * Dropdown menu (Combobox, DatePicker, et al.) placement is typically bottom-aligned and should be allowed to invert its placement when inside a boundary element this often happens within a modal. Dropdowns should not overflow boundary elements , since most boundary elements scroll vertically and have space for the menu.\n *\n * * If they are hidden, left and right placed overlay elements (such as Popover and Tooltip) should be placed within a portal element attached to the DOM <body>, but styled to align to its target/trigger. Since scrolling typically occurs on the vertical axis, this allows them to overflow boundary elements and still allow scrolling of content, yet still invert placement for the browser viewport. Portal elements are only necessary if an original ancestor boundary element exists. **No portals are created by default.**\n *\n * * Nubbins/arrows should be repositioned for any new placement/alignment.\n *\n * Allow Overflowing of Boundary Element: Allow applications to create a portal element attached to the DOM <body> to be outside of boundary elements if manual testing shows confusing alignment/poor usability/readability. This should be exception and not the default.\n *\n * Allow Inverted placement: Allow applications to prevent inverted placement if manual testing shows confusing alignment/poor usability/readability.\n *\n * ### How this new Dialog component works\n * * There is no longer an inline render within components. All overlays should go through `Dialog`. `position: relative` just passes on the markup with some additional event listeners. No positional library is used.\n * * The default `position: absolute` will run through three renders. It will first render the overlay at `0px/0px` offset of its parent. It will then store the target DOM node, once the DOM node is set, a state change will occur and tell a PopperJS instance to be created on update, once it is created, a third render is done to update the styles created by PopperJS.\n * * `position: overflowBoundaryElement` will do the same three renders as `absolute` except that the initial render will create a disconnected render tree (portal) on the `body`. Then, the position will change once the target is stored. The portal itself will be rendered multiple times. The first will result in `onOpen` executing. Each update will result in a re-render of the disconnected render-tree.\n *\n * This component is private.\n */\nconst Dialog = createReactClass({\n\tdisplayName: DIALOG,\n\n\tpropTypes: {\n\t\t/**\n\t\t * Aligns the right or left side of the dialog with the respective side of the target.\n\t\t */\n\t\talign: PropTypes.oneOf([\n\t\t\t'top',\n\t\t\t'top left',\n\t\t\t'top right',\n\t\t\t'right',\n\t\t\t'right top',\n\t\t\t'right bottom',\n\t\t\t'bottom',\n\t\t\t'bottom left',\n\t\t\t'bottom right',\n\t\t\t'left',\n\t\t\t'left top',\n\t\t\t'left bottom'\n\t\t]),\n\t\t/**\n\t\t * CSS classes to be added to the absolutely positioned element.\n\t\t */\n\t\tclassName: PropTypes.oneOfType([\n\t\t\tPropTypes.array,\n\t\t\tPropTypes.object,\n\t\t\tPropTypes.string\n\t\t]),\n\t\t/**\n\t\t * CSS classes to be added to the wrapping `div` of the contents of the dialog.\n\t\t */\n\t\tcontentsClassName: PropTypes.oneOfType([\n\t\t\tPropTypes.array,\n\t\t\tPropTypes.object,\n\t\t\tPropTypes.string\n\t\t]),\n\t\t/**\n\t\t * Contents of dialog\n\t\t */\n\t\tchildren: PropTypes.node.isRequired,\n\t\t/**\n\t\t * Closes dialog when tab key is pressed\n\t\t */\n\t\tcloseOnTabKey: PropTypes.bool,\n\t\t/**\n\t\t * Props passed along to wrapping div.

To prevent this you can add the following to your application with `#mount` being the root node of your application that you would like to hide from assistive technologies when the `Modal` is open.\n * ```\n * import settings from 'design-system-react/components/settings';\n * settings.setAppElement('#mount');\n * ```\n * This component uses a portalMount (a disconnected React subtree mount) to create a modal as a child of `body`.\n */\nclass Modal extends React.Component {\n\tconstructor (props) {\n\t\tsuper(props);\n\t\tthis.state = {\n\t\t\tisClosing: false\n\t\t};\n\n\t\t// Bind\n\t\tthis.handleModalClick = this.handleModalClick.bind(this);\n\t\tthis.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this);\n\t\tthis.dismissModalOnClickOutside = this.dismissModalOnClickOutside.bind(\n\t\t\tthis\n\t\t);\n\t}\n\n\tsetReturnFocus () {\n\t\tthis.setState({\n\t\t\treturnFocusTo: document.activeElement\n\t\t});\n\t}\n\n\tcomponentDidMount () {\n\t\tthis.setReturnFocus();\n\t\tthis.updateBodyScroll();\n\t}\n\n\tcomponentDidUpdate (prevProps, prevState) {\n\t\tif (this.props.isOpen !== prevProps.isOpen) {\n\t\t\tthis.updateBodyScroll();\n\t\t}\n\t\tif (this.state.isClosing !== prevState.isClosing) {\n\t\t\tif (this.state.isClosing) {\n\t\t\t\t// console.log(\"CLOSING: ');\n\t\t\t\tif (!this.isUnmounting) {\n\t\t\t\t\tconst el = ReactDOM.findDOMNode(this).parentNode; // eslint-disable-line react/no-find-dom-node\n\t\t\t\t\tif (el && el.getAttribute('data-slds-modal')) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\tReactDOM.unmountComponentAtNode(el);\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdocument.body.removeChild(el);\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n\tcomponentWillMount () {\n\t\tthis.generatedId = shortid.generate();\n\t}\n\n\tcomponentWillUnmount () {\n\t\tthis.isUnmounting = true;\n\t\tthis.clearBodyScroll();\n\t}\n\n\tgetId () {\n\t\treturn this.props.id || this.generatedId;\n\t}\n\n\tdismissModalOnClickOutside () {\n\t\t// if dismissOnClickOutside is not set, default its value to dismissible\n\t\tconst dismissOnClickOutside = isBoolean(this.props.dismissOnClickOutside)\n\t\t\t? this.props.dismissOnClickOutside\n\t\t\t: this.props.dismissible;\n\n\t\tif (dismissOnClickOutside) {\n\t\t\tthis.dismissModal();\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n\tcloseModal () {\n\t\tif (this.props.dismissible) {\n\t\t\tthis.dismissModal();\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n\tdismissModal () {\n\t\tthis.setState({ isClosing: true });\n\t\tif (this.state.returnFocusTo && this.state.returnFocusTo.focus) {\n\t\t\tthis.state.returnFocusTo.focus();\n\t\t}\n\t\tif (this.props.onRequestClose) {\n\t\t\tthis.props.onRequestClose();\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n\thandleSubmitModal () {\n\t\tthis.closeModal();\n\t}\n\n\tupdateBodyScroll () {\n\t\tif (window && document && document.body) {\n\t\t\tif (this.props.isOpen) {\n\t\t\t\tdocument.body.style.overflow = 'hidden';\n\t\t\t} else {\n\t\t\t\tdocument.body.style.overflow = 'inherit';\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n\tclearBodyScroll () {\n\t\t// eslint-disable-line class-methods-use-this\n\t\tif (window && document && document.body) {\n\t\t\tdocument.body.style.overflow = 'inherit';\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n\thandleModalClick (event) {\n\t\t// eslint-disable-line class-methods-use-this\n\t\tif (event && event.stopPropagation) {\n\t\t\tevent.stopPropagation();\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n\tisPrompt () {\n\t\treturn this.props.prompt !== undefined;\n\t}\n\n\tfooterComponent () {\n\t\tlet footer = null;\n\t\tconst hasFooter = this.props.footer;\n\t\tconst footerClass = {\n\t\t\t'slds-modal__footer': true,\n\t\t\t'slds-modal__footer--directional': this.props.directional,\n\t\t\t'slds-theme--default': this.isPrompt()\n\t\t};\n\n\t\tif (hasFooter) {\n\t\t\t// eslint-disable-next-line jsx-a11y/no-static-element-interactions\n\t\t\tfooter = (\n\t\t\t\t<footer\n\t\t\t\t\tclassName={classNames(footerClass, this.props.footerClassNames)}\n\t\t\t\t\tonClick={this.handleModalClick}\n\t\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t\t\t{this.props.footer}\n\t\t\t\t</footer>\n\t\t\t);\n\t\t}\n\t\treturn footer;\n\t}\n\n\theaderComponent () {\n\t\tlet headerContent = this.props.header;\n\t\tconst headerEmpty =\n\t\t\t!headerContent && !this.props.title && !this.props.tagline;\n\t\tconst closeButtonAssistiveText =\n\t\t\tthis.props.closeButtonAssistiveText || 'Close';\n\t\tconst closeButton = (\n\t\t\t<Button\n\t\t\t\tassistiveText={closeButtonAssistiveText}\n\t\t\t\ticonName=\"close\"\n\t\t\t\ticonSize=\"large\"\n\t\t\t\tinverse\n\t\t\t\tclassName=\"slds-modal__close\"\n\t\t\t\tonClick={this.closeModal}\n\t\t\t\ttitle={closeButtonAssistiveText}\n\t\t\t\tvariant=\"icon\"\n\t\t\t/>\n\t\t);\n\n\t\tif ((!headerContent && this.props.title) || this.props.tagline) {\n\t\t\theaderContent = (\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t{this.props.toast}\n\t\t\t\t\t<h2\n\t\t\t\t\t\tclassName={classNames({\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t'slds-text-heading--small': this.isPrompt(),\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t'slds-text-heading--medium': !this.isPrompt()\n\t\t\t\t\t\t})}\n\t\t\t\t\t\tid={this.getId()}\n\t\t\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t{this.props.title}\n\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t{this.props.tagline ?
