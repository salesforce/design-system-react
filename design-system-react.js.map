It typically overlays other elements in the document flow. This is achieved with elevation (`z-index`) and one of the following: relative position, absolute position, or a new top-level React render tree (portal). A boundary element is a scrolling ancestor element or the edge of the browser (window/viewport). This element typically has an overflow (overflow-y/overflow-x) style that is scroll, hidden, or auto. Inverted placement is the flipping of the overlay element from top to bottom or left to right in order stay within a boundary element.\n *\n * * Dropdown menu (Combobox, DatePicker, et al.) placement is typically bottom-aligned and should be allowed to invert its placement when inside a boundary element this often happens within a modal. Dropdowns should not overflow boundary elements , since most boundary elements scroll vertically and have space for the menu.\n *\n * * If they are hidden, left and right placed overlay elements (such as Popover and Tooltip) should be placed within a portal element attached to the DOM <body>, but styled to align to its target/trigger. Since scrolling typically occurs on the vertical axis, this allows them to overflow boundary elements and still allow scrolling of content, yet still invert placement for the browser viewport. Portal elements are only necessary if an original ancestor boundary element exists. **No portals are created by default.**\n *\n * * Nubbins/arrows should be repositioned for any new placement/alignment.\n *\n * Allow Overflowing of Boundary Element: Allow applications to create a portal element attached to the DOM <body> to be outside of boundary elements if manual testing shows confusing alignment/poor usability/readability. This should be exception and not the default.\n *\n * Allow Inverted placement: Allow applications to prevent inverted placement if manual testing shows confusing alignment/poor usability/readability.\n *\n * ### How this new Dialog component works\n * * There is no longer an inline render within components. All overlays should go through `Dialog`. `position: relative` just passes on the markup with some additional event listeners. No positional library is used.\n * * The default `position: absolute` will run through three renders. It will first render the overlay at `0px/0px` offset of its parent. It will then store the target DOM node, once the DOM node is set, a state change will occur and tell a PopperJS instance to be created on update, once it is created, a third render is done to update the styles created by PopperJS.\n * * `position: overflowBoundaryElement` will do the same three renders as `absolute` except that the initial render will create a disconnected render tree (portal) on the `body`. Then, the position will change once the target is stored. The portal itself will be rendered multiple times. The first will result in `onOpen` executing.

If `initals` prop is unavailable but a `label` prop is available, the fallback avatar will render with built initials of the user name or entity name.\n\n Intials built from the `label` prop will apply the following logic: If the label name contains two words, like first and last name, the first letter of each will be capitalized and returned. For labels that only have a single word name, the first two letters of that word, using one capital and one lower case letter, will be returned. For labels that contain three or more words, the first character of the first and last words will be capitalized and returned.\n\n If `initials` or `label` are not available, the fallback avatar will render a standard icon. If `variant='user'`, a user icon will\n render. If `variant='entity'`, an account icon will render.\n */\n\nclass Avatar extends React.Component {\n\tconstructor(props) {\n\t\tsuper(props);\n\t\tthis.state = {\n\t\t\timgLoadError: false,\n\t\t};\n\t}\n\n\tcomponentWillMount() {\n\t\tcheckProps(AVATAR, this.props, componentDoc);\n\t}\n\n\tbuildInitials() {\n\t\tconst { label } = this.props;\n\t\tconst name = label.trim();\n\t\tconst nameParts = name.split(' ');\n\t\tif (nameParts.length > 1) {\n\t\t\treturn (\n\t\t\t\tnameParts[0].charAt(0).toUpperCase() +\n\t\t\t\tnameParts[nameParts.length - 1].charAt(0).toUpperCase()\n\t\t\t);\n\t\t}\n\t\treturn (name[0] || '').toUpperCase() + (name[1] || '').toLowerCase();\n\t}\n\n\thandleImageError() {\n\t\treturn this.setState(() => ({ imgLoadError: true }));\n\t}\n\n\trenderBaseAvatar() {\n\t\tconst { imgAlt, imgSrc, title } = this.props;\n\t\treturn (\n\t\t\t<img\n\t\t\t\talt={imgAlt}\n\t\t\t\tsrc={imgSrc}\n\t\t\t\tonError={() => this.handleImageError()}\n\t\t\t\ttitle={title}\n\t\t\t/>\n\t\t);\n\t}\n\n\trenderIconAvatar() {\n\t\tconst { variant } = this.props;\n\t\tconst iconAssistiveText =\n\t\t\ttypeof this.props.assistiveText === 'string'\n\t\t\t\t? this.props.assistiveText\n\t\t\t\t: {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t...defaultProps.assistiveText,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t...this.props.assistiveText,\n\t\t\t\t\t}.icon;\n\t\treturn (\n\t\t\t<UtilityIcon\n\t\t\t\tassistiveText={{ label: iconAssistiveText }}\n\t\t\t\tcategory=\"standard\"\n\t\t\t\tname={variant === 'entity' ?
