This is necessary for proper styling (especially positioning). A dialog is a non-modal container that separates content from the rest of the web application. This library uses the Drop library (https://github.com/HubSpot/drop which is based on TetherJS) to absolutely position and align content to another item on the page. This component is not meant for external consumption or part of the published component API.\n*/\nconst Dialog = React.createClass({\n\n\tdisplayName: DIALOG,\n\n\tpropTypes: {\n\t\t/**\n\t\t * Aligns the right or left side of the dialog with the respective side of the target.\n\t\t */\n\t\talign: PropTypes.oneOf([\n\t\t\t'top',\n\t\t\t'top left',\n\t\t\t'top right',\n\t\t\t'right',\n\t\t\t'right top',\n\t\t\t'right bottom',\n\t\t\t'bottom',\n\t\t\t'bottom left',\n\t\t\t'bottom right',\n\t\t\t'left',\n\t\t\t'left top',\n\t\t\t'left bottom'\n\t\t]),\n\t\t/**\n\t\t * CSS classes to be added to the absolutely positioned element.\n\t\t */\n\t\tclassName: PropTypes.oneOfType([\n\t\t\tPropTypes.array,\n\t\t\tPropTypes.object,\n\t\t\tPropTypes.string]\n\t\t),\n\t\t/**\n\t\t * CSS classes to be added to the wrapping `div` of the contents of the dialog.\n\t\t */\n\t\tcontentsClassName: PropTypes.oneOfType([\n\t\t\tPropTypes.array,\n\t\t\tPropTypes.object,\n\t\t\tPropTypes.string]\n\t\t),\n\t\t/**\n\t\t * Contents of dialog\n\t\t**/\n\t\tchildren: PropTypes.node,\n\t\t/**\n\t\t * Closes dialog when tab key is pressed\n\t\t**/\n\t\tcloseOnTabKey: PropTypes.bool,\n\t\t/**\n\t\t * If true, the dialog is constrained to the scrolling parent and may be flipped up instead of down.
