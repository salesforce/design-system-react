The Modal opens from a state change outside of the component itself (pass this state to the <code>isOpen</code> prop). For more details on the Prompt markup, please review the <a href=\"http://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/components/notifications#prompt\">Notifications > Prompt</a>.\n *\n * By default, `Modal` will add `aria-hidden=true` to the `body` tag, but this disables some assistive technologies. To prevent this you can add the following to your application with `#mount` being the root node of your application that you would like to hide from assistive technologies when the `Modal` is open.\n * ```\n * import settings from 'design-system-react/components/settings';\n * settings.setAppElement('#mount');\n * ```\n *\n * This component uses a portalMount (a disconnected React subtree mount) to create a modal as a child of `body`.\n */\nclass Modal extends React.Component {\n\n\tconstructor (props) {\n\t\tsuper(props);\n\t\tthis.state = {\n\t\t\tisClosing: false,\n\t\t\trevealed: false\n\t\t};\n\n\t\t// Bind\n\t\tthis.handleModalClick = this.handleModalClick.bind(this);\n\t\tthis.closeModal = this.closeModal.bind(this);\n\t\tthis.dismissModalOnClickOutside = this.dismissModalOnClickOutside.bind(this);\n\t}\n\n\tsetReturnFocus () {\n\t\tthis.setState({\n\t\t\treturnFocusTo: document.activeElement\n\t\t});\n\t}\n\n\tcomponentDidMount () {\n\t\tthis.setReturnFocus();\n\n\t\tif (!this.state.revealed) {\n\t\t\tsetTimeout(() => {\n\t\t\t\tthis.setState({ revealed: true });\n\t\t\t});\n\t\t}\n\t\tthis.updateBodyScroll();\n\t}\n\n\tcomponentDidUpdate (prevProps, prevState) {\n\t\tif (this.props.isOpen !== prevProps.isOpen) {\n\t\t\tthis.updateBodyScroll();\n\t\t}\n\t\tif (this.state.isClosing !== prevState.isClosing) {\n\t\t\tif (this.state.isClosing) {\n\t\t\t\t// console.log(\"CLOSING: ');\n\t\t\t\tif (!this.isUnmounting) {\n\t\t\t\t\tconst el = ReactDOM.findDOMNode(this).parentNode; // eslint-disable-line react/no-find-dom-node\n\t\t\t\t\tif (el && el.getAttribute('data-slds-modal')) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\tReactDOM.unmountComponentAtNode(el);\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdocument.body.removeChild(el);\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n\tcomponentWillMount () {\n\t\tthis.generatedId = shortid.generate();\n\t}\n\n\tcomponentWillUnmount () {\n\t\tthis.isUnmounting = true;\n\t\tthis.clearBodyScroll();\n\t}\n\n\tgetId () {\n\t\treturn this.props.id || this.generatedId;\n\t}\n\n\tdismissModalOnClickOutside () {\n\t\t// if dismissOnClickOutside is not set, default its value to dismissible\n\t\tconst dismissOnClickOutside = isBoolean(this.props.dismissOnClickOutside)\n\t\t\t?
