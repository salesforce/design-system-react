# Frequently Asked Questions

### What is the Lightning Design System?

The Salesforce Lightning Design System (referred to as SLDS) is a collection of design patterns, component specifications, and guidelines for creating unified UI in the Salesforce ecosystem. Teams should familiarize themselves with SLDS by visiting the [Lightning Design System](https://internal.lightningdesignsystem.com/) tile in Aloha. SLDS also defines markup and CSS to implement the components in a web environment.


### How is the Design System React library of components different than the Lightning Design System?

The Salesforce Lightning Design System is largely a CSS framework that implements the Salesforce visual and interaction design guidelines and patterns. As such, the static components provided are purely markup-based (HTML/CSS) and lack the JavaScript to be interactive. Design System React solves this problem by exposing a set of accessible React components. You can think of Design System React as the React implementation of SLDS which provides consistent interactivity, functionality, accessibility, and a defined API. To create consistency for our customers, use of Design System React is highly recommended.


### How do I start using  Design System React components in my project?

Visit the [Getting Started](/getting-started/) page for set up instructions. Core maintainers are available at [Office Hours](https://plus.google.com/hangouts/_/salesforce.com/react) on Tuesdays, 4pm EST / 1pm PST to talk through any issues you are having, too.

### Are the Design System React components accessible?

We strive to make all components accessible for keyboard users and screen readers, and to that end all of the components go through accessibility review. If you find any accessibility bugs, please submit a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/salesforce-ux/design-system-react/issues).


### Which version of React and SLDS do you support?

Design System React is optimized for React ${reactVersion} and uses Lightning Design System ${sldsVersion}.


### Which browsers are supported?

We support the same browsers as the Lightning Design System. Please visit [Lightning Design System - FAQ](http://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/faq/#what-browsers-are-supported) for details.
