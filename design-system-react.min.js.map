This is necessary for proper styling (especially positioning). A dialog is a non-modal container that separates content from the rest of the web application. This library uses the Drop library (https://github.com/HubSpot/drop which is based on TetherJS) to absolutely position and align content to another item on the page. This component is not meant for external consumption or part of the published component API.\n\t*/\n\t\n\t\n\t// ### onClickOutside\n\t// Listen for clicks that occur somewhere in the document, outside of the element itself\n\t/* Copyright (c) 2015-present, salesforce.com, inc.
