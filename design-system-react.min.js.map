Tabbing to an index outside of the dialog is not allowed. Popover must be closed first via ESC.\n\t * - There should always be a focusable element inside, to place user focus on such as a close button\n\t * - Must be dismissible via ESC and a close button\n\t * - Uses tabIndex in wrapper and has tabbable items within it despite being outside document flow.\n\t * - Entire popover receives focus when opened and has a aria-labelledby that points to the header id, so it will read the heading,\n\t * - Must return focus to trigger after closing.\n\t * - F6 will allow the user to keep popover open and go back to tabbing in “app-context” instead of “dialog-context.” (not implemented, yet)\n\t */\n\t\n\t// ## Dependencies\n\t\n\t// ### React\n\tvar internalHandleClick = function internalHandleClick(_ref) {\n\t\tvar trigger = _ref.trigger,\n\t\t    eventTarget = _ref.eventTarget,\n\t\t    handleClick = _ref.handleClick;\n\t\n\t\tif (trigger && _reactDom2.default.findDOMNode(trigger) === eventTarget) {\n\t\t\thandleClick(event);\n\t\t}\n\t};\n\t\n\t// ### Event Helpers\n\t\n\t\n\tvar KeyboardNavigableDialog = function KeyboardNavigableDialog(_ref2) {\n\t\tvar isOpen = _ref2.isOpen,\n\t\t    handleClick = _ref2.handleClick,\n\t\t    keyCode = _ref2.keyCode,\n\t\t    eventTarget = _ref2.eventTarget,\n\t\t    trigger = _ref2.trigger,\n\t\t    toggleOpen = _ref2.toggleOpen;\n\t\n\t\tswitch (keyCode) {\n\t\t\tcase _keys2.default.ESCAPE:\n\t\t\t\tif (isOpen) {\n\t\t\t\t\ttoggleOpen();\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\tbreak;\n\t\t\tcase _keys2.default.ENTER:\n\t\t\t\tif (!isOpen) {\n\t\t\t\t\tinternalHandleClick({\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttrigger: trigger,\n\t\t\t\t\t\teventTarget: eventTarget,\n\t\t\t\t\t\thandleClick: handleClick\n\t\t\t\t\t});\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\tbreak;\n\t\t\tdefault:\n\t\t\t\tbreak;\n\t\t}\n\t};\n\t\n\tmodule.exports = KeyboardNavigableDialog;\n\n/***/ },\n/* 139 */\n/***/ function(module, exports, __webpack_require__) {\n\n\t'use strict';\n\t\n\tvar _extends = Object.assign || function (target) { for (var i = 1; i < arguments.length; i++) { var source = arguments[i]; for (var key in source) { if (Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(source, key)) { target[key] = source[key]; } } } return target; };\n\t\n\tvar _react = __webpack_require__(5);\n\t\n\tvar _react2 = _interopRequireDefault(_react);\n\t\n\tvar _reactDom = __webpack_require__(6);\n\t\n\tvar _reactDom2 = _interopRequireDefault(_reactDom);\n\t\n\tvar _lodash = __webpack_require__(57);\n\t\n\tvar _lodash2 = _interopRequireDefault(_lodash);\n\t\n\tvar _button = __webpack_require__(15);\n\t\n\tvar _button2 = _interopRequireDefault(_button);\n\t\n\tvar _index = __webpack_require__(69);\n\t\n\tvar _index2 = _interopRequireDefault(_index);\n\t\n\tvar _inputIcon = __webpack_require__(70);\n\t\n\tvar _inputIcon2 = _interopRequireDefault(_inputIcon);\n\t\n\tvar _utilities = __webpack_require__(75);\n\t\n\tvar _constants = __webpack_require__(28);\n\t\n\tfunction _interopRequireDefault(obj) { return obj && obj.__esModule ? obj : { default: obj }; }\n\t\n\tfunction _objectWithoutProperties(obj, keys) { var target = {}; for (var i in obj) { if (keys.indexOf(i) >= 0) continue; if (!Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(obj, i)) continue; target[i] = obj[i]; } return target; } /*\n\t                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Copyright (c) 2015, salesforce.com, inc.
