# fuelux-facades [![Build Status](http://teamcity/app/rest/builds/buildType:StackatoCloudApplications_FuelFacades/statusIcon)](http://teamcity/viewType.html?buildTypeId=StackatoCloudApplications_FuelFacades)
Testing a core abstraction layer with many facades approach for FuelUX

### Setup
* Clone the project
* Have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) installed
* Run `npm install` via terminal in the directory where the project has been cloned

### Running
* Run `npm start` to start a static server on port 8000. You can navigate to `http://localhost:8000/` to see a simple index page with links to examples in each facade

### Building
* Run `grunt` for the default build. This will create the example file(s). Note that the serve task also has a watch task so this step is optional
