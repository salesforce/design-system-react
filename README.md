## Install

```
$ npm install @salesforce-ux/design-system @salesforce/design-system-react
```

## Getting Started

Welcome to the project! :wave: This library is the [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) implementation of the [Salesforce Lightning Design System](https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/). This library has a peer dependency on `@salesforce-ux/design-system`, `react`, and `react-dom`. It is tested with React 16 and has a stable API despite its version number. Please [polyfill](https://github.com/salesforce/design-system-react/blob/master/docs/browser-compatibility.md) this library in order to meet your target environment needs.

## Usage

### Quick Setup (CommonJS)

For a no hassle setup and compatibility with Create React App v1, a CommonJS version has been included within the NPM package. If using this setup, please re-write the `import` statement in the documentation site examples. Use the following named `import` syntax to access CommonJS components from `/lib/index.js`:

```
import { Button } from '@salesforce/design-system-react';

<Button label="Hello Button" />
```

Please view [Create React App Setup](docs/create-react-app.md) for more information on using this library with Create React App.

### Advanced (Source code)

Advanced usage requires that your babel presets are set up correctly. `create-react-app` and environments that do not transpile code within `node_modules` are not compatible with the component import below. All the examples on the [documentation site](https://react.lightningdesignsystem.com/) use this syntax. You can use the Babel preset, `@salesforce/babel-preset-design-system-react`, to get started. [This preset](https://npmjs.com/package/@salesforce/babel-preset-design-system-react) will keep Babel compatible with Design System React and allow ES6 module benefits such as tree-shaking. This library is not browser-ready and should be polyfilled to your target environment.

```
import Button from '@salesforce/design-system-react/components/button';

<Button label="Hello Button" />
```

#### Transpile with `.babelrc` settings

```json
{
	"presets": ["@salesforce/babel-preset-design-system-react"]
}
```

### Styling

This library does not contain any Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). You will need to add `<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/node_modules/@salesforce-ux/design-system/assets/styles/salesforce-lightning-design-system.min.css" />` to your page and serve that file from a publicly available folder.

#### Serve icons publicly

Typically, scripts should be downloaded in the background without blocking the DOM. With React, this works best with [server side rendering](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom-server.html#rendertostaticmarkup). SLDS recommends placeholder stencils while scripts are initializing if the HTML cannot be served immediately. If you can serve the HTML, then icon SVGs should not be bundled and served like any other file. Set a path `context` for all child components with `<IconSettings>` at the top of your render tree:

```
import IconSettings from '@salesforce/design-system-react/components/icon-settings';

ReactDOM.render(
  <IconSettings iconPath="/assets/icons">
    <MyApp />
  </IconSettings>,
  document.getElementById('app')
)

// `/assets/icons` will be prepended to `/standard-sprite/svg/symbols.svg#account` within the SVG path
<svg aria-hidden="true" class="slds-icon">
  <use xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="/assets/icons/standard-sprite/svg/symbols.svg#account"></use>
</svg>
```

```
// ExpressJS example
app.use('/assets/icons', express.static('node_modules/@salesforce-ux/design-system/assets/icons/'));
```

#### Bundle icons

If you use a module bundler, like Webpack, you can let your module bundler manage SVG sprite file paths and send that path into `<IconSettings>`. This requires configuring your module bundler to manage your public assets.

```
import IconSettings from '@salesforce/design-system-react/components/icon-settings';
import standardSprite from '@salesforce-ux/design-system/assets/icons/standard-sprite/svg/symbols.svg';
...
...

ReactDOM.render(
  <IconSettings standardSprite={standardSprite}>
    <MyApp />
  </IconSettings>,
  document.getElementById('app')
)
```

### Icon Usage

Prior to v0.7.0, SLDS icons were bundled with the JavaScript. The 400KB+ icons bundle from [SLDS](https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/) is no longer included. You will need to download the SLDS CSS and icons separately.

Bundled script files are provided _only_ for convenience. Do not use in production.

* `design-system-react.min.js` (700KB+) - includes icons in the JavaScript
* `design-system-react-components.min.js` (~400KB) - no icons.

## Contributing to the code base

#### Clone and develop locally with Storybook and in-browser tests

```
git clone git@github.com:salesforce/design-system-react.git
cd design-system-react
npm install
npm start
open http://localhost:9001 http://localhost:8001
```

Please read the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) and [Test README](/tests/README.md) first. Then, create an issue to tell others you are working on a bug. If you would like to contribute a new component, create an issue with a list of proposed props to discuss with maintainers. Issues not addressed with pull requests may be closed eventually. Check out [who's contributing](https://github.com/salesforce/design-system-react/graphs/contributors) to the project.

## Got feedback?

If you have support questions, please post a question to [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/design-system-react) and tag with `design-system-react`. If you find any bugs, create a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/salesforce/design-system-react/issues).

## Security

Please report any security issue to [security@salesforce.com](mailto:security@salesforce.com) as soon as it is discovered. This library limits its runtime dependencies in order to reduce the total cost of ownership as much as can be, but all consumers should remain vigilant and have their security stakeholders review all third-party dependencies.
