# Additional Resources

Suggested reading when getting started with React and Redux in your project. After understanding the concepts below, the Concepts and Best Practices section of the [Contributing page](/contributing) should be more clear.

### React documentation

React's documentation can be a bit chaotic at times but is still the best place to start. Here are the highlights from it that you definitely shouldn't miss.

- [Why React](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2013/06/05/why-react.html) - React isn't an MVC framework
- [Thinking in React](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/thinking-in-react.html) - A short tutorial
- [Displaying data](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/displaying-data.html)
- [interactivity and dynamic UIs](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/interactivity-and-dynamic-uis.html)
- [Reusable components](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/reusable-components.html)
- [Tutorial](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tutorial.html)
- [Controlled](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/forms.html#controlled-components) and [uncontrolled](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/forms.html#uncontrolled-components) components

Great getting started resource about component size, functional components, stateless components, and more

- [9 things every React.js beginner should know](https://camjackson.net/post/9-things-every-reactjs-beginner-should-know)

Understanding when to use Props vs. State is of primary importance in the React world, so you may find this overview helpful when getting started.

- [Props vs. state](https://github.com/uberVU/react-guide/blob/master/props-vs-state.md)

Bookmarking this simple React cheatsheet would also be a good idea. It's a helpful reference for the component lifecycle, React's PropTypes and more.

- [React cheatsheet](http://ricostacruz.com/cheatsheets/react.html)

Finally, a couple more articles to round out your reading list.

- [React best practices](https://www.toptal.com/react/tips-and-practices)
- [Make Your React Components Pretty](https://medium.com/walmartlabs/make-your-react-components-pretty-a1ae4ec0f56e#.7w48sjpyl): stateless functional components, conditional components, and general syntax suggestions
- [About immutability](http://reactkungfu.com/2015/08/pros-and-cons-of-using-immutability-with-react-js/)

#### Advanded React
- [React Higher Order Components in depth](https://medium.com/@franleplant/react-higher-order-components-in-depth-cf9032ee6c3e#.mt61gwc6h)
    - Inheritance Inversion
    - Code reuse, logic and bootstrap abstraction
    - Render Highjacking
    - State abstraction and manipulation
    - Props manipulation and proxy


### Redux documentation

For Redux, the documentation is absolutely fantastic and can (should!) be read straight through from start to finish.

- [Redux docs](http://redux.js.org/docs/introduction/index.html)
- [Very helpful FAQ section](http://redux.js.org/docs/FAQ.html)

Some additional Flux architecture / Redux reading when you're ready to go a little further (but read the documentation above first).

- [Presentational and container components](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/smart-and-dumb-components-7ca2f9a7c7d0#.qzfzvg6th)
- [Managing data flow on the client-side](https://blog.madewithlove.be/post/redux/)
- [Redux best practices](https://medium.com/lexical-labs-engineering/redux-best-practices-64d59775802e#.k4jk8u4us)
- [Annotated Connect](https://gist.github.com/gaearon/1d19088790e70ac32ea636c025ba424e)
- [Understanding the functional revolution in front-end applications](http://blog.reactandbethankful.com/posts/2015/09/15/understanding-the-functional-revolution/)
- [Components as higher order functions](https://blog.risingstack.com/functional-ui-and-components-as-higher-order-functions/)
- [Encapsulation in Redux](http://blog.javascripting.com/2016/02/02/encapsulation-in-redux/)

If you're more of a visual thinker here are two great intros, to Flux in general and then more specifically to Redux, done with cartoons.

- [Redux](https://code-cartoons.com/a-cartoon-intro-to-redux-3afb775501a6#.vqzqcv77y)
