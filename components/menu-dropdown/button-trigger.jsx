// # Dropdown Trigger Component (Simple Button Flavor) --- SLDS for React

// ### React
// React is an external dependency of the project.
import React, { PropTypes } from 'react';
import Button from '../button';

// ### Children
import { MENU_DROPDOWN_TRIGGER } from '../../utilities/constants';

/**
 *  The Dropdown Button Trigger renders the default trigger button for the dropdown menu. If this component has children, it does not render itself to the DOM. Instead, it renders its child element, `Button`, and all that child's properties. This component may be used as a template to create custom triggers that do not use `Button`.

		 * Import the module `design-system-react/dropdown/button-trigger` and render a grandchild of the element type `Button`. Any `props` specified on that `Button` will be assigned to the triggering button. Any `id` prop or event hanlders (`onBlur`, `onClick`, etc.) set on the button grandchild will be overwritten by `MenuDropdown` to allow functionality and accessibility.
