Testing our vanilliajs -> many frameworks concept by converting Fuel UX controls to this new approach

### Setup
* Clone the project
* Have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) installed
* Run `npm install` via terminal in the directory where the project has been cloned

### Building
* Run `gulp` for the default build. This will create the dist file(s)

### Serving
* Run `gulp serve` to start a static server on port 3000. You can navigate to `http://localhost:3000/` to see a simple index page with examples, or `http://localhost:3000/dev/dev.html` to work on a control in isolation
